- Apply the garment from Garment Image 1 so it fits naturally on the model's body and REPLACE any conflicting clothing of the same category from the Person Image. If a second garment image is supplied, only layer it when it is naturally worn on top; otherwise it should also replace the original clothing: {GARMENT_1_DESCRIPTION}. {GARMENT_2_AND_LAYOUT_DESCRIPTION}
- Remove or hide any part of the original outfit that should no longer be visible, ensuring no remnants of the previous garment remain.
- Keep the model's facial features, identity, pose, body shape, skin tone, and hair exactly the same as in the Person Image.
- Preserve the original background and keep it clean, simple, and neutralâ€”remove any garment artefacts that do not belong in the scene.
- Match lighting, shadows, and overall style to the Person Image. Use {STYLE_AESTHETIC} styling with {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION}.
- Maintain the original framing, camera perspective, and natural photographic quality, as if shot with a {CAMERA_LENS_TYPE} producing {CAMERA_EFFECTS}.
- Avoid any distortions, extra limbs, or visual artefacts. Do not add text or graphics.

Return only the final photorealistic image.
